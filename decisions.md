## How to Log Decisions

Each entry uses a structured format that feeds into Meta Tracker's decision tree. The key fields:

| Field | Values | When to Use |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Type** | decision · event · dead-end · discovery · pivot | What kind of entry this is |
| **Category** | technical · functional · ux-design · process | What domain it belongs to |
| **Chosen path** | Free text | What we actually did (decisions/pivots only) |
| **Alternatives** | List | What else we considered (decisions/pivots only) |
| **Failure reason** | Free text | Why it didn't work (dead-ends only) |

Both models should log decisions — not just the model that made them. If Cursor discovers something important, log it here.

## Entries

### Getting Organized

**Summary:** Setting up workflow and coordination for multi-model collaboration
**Sessions:** 1
**Phase:** Spec
**AI Tools:** Claude Code

---

#### Multi-Model Coordination Protocol
- **Type:** decision
- **Category:** process
- **Context:** Two AI models (Claude Code and Cursor) need to work on the same repo in parallel without stepping on each other.
- **Chosen path:** Task index coordination with branch prefixes and file-level conflict detection
- **Alternatives:** (1) Domain separation (backend vs frontend ownership) — too rigid. (2) Sequential turns — too slow, kills parallelism. (3) Forking the repo per model — too much overhead to sync.
- **Why this path:** Uses existing task tracking infrastructure. File-level conflict detection is simple and sufficient. Branch prefixes make ownership visible. The task index is the single coordination point.
- **Outcome:** Implemented in PR #1

#### Workflow Documentation in Repo
- **Type:** decision
- **Category:** process
- **Context:** Both models need access to the workflow system. Cursor reads from the repo; Claude Code reads from CLAUDE.md and repo files.
- **Chosen path:** Shared .workflow/ docs with model-specific entry points (.cursorrules, CLAUDE.md)
- **Alternatives:** (1) External docs only. (2) Single shared config file.
- **Why this path:** Each model has its own entry point (`.cursorrules` vs `CLAUDE.md`) but shares the same workflow docs. No duplication of process rules.
- **Outcome:** Implemented in PR #1

---

#### Repo Migration — Remove Fork Association
- **Type:** decision
- **Category:** process
- **Context:** hrpatel/vuln-bank was a fork of Commando-X/vuln-bank. Git tooling (gh) auto-created PRs against the upstream repo, leaking work to a public project.
- **Chosen path:** Delete the fork, recreate as a standalone repo, re-push all content
- **Alternatives:** (1) Remove upstream remote only — doesn't fix the GitHub fork association. (2) Keep the fork and be careful — too error-prone.
- **Why this path:** Clean break eliminates the risk entirely. All content was backed up locally before deletion.
- **Outcome:** New standalone repo at same URL, PR #3 re-created successfully, no data lost
